# aWCluster
Integrative Network_based Clustering of Multiomics
Here we present a novel network-based integration method of multiomics data as well as a clustering technique founded on the Wasserstein (Earth Mover's) distance from the theory of optimal mass transport.    https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/558700v1.
aWCluster integrates mRNA expression, DNA copy number alteration, and DNA methylation as well as the interaction network connectivity of the gene products.
A sample of these data for 100 breast cancer (tcga) patients and 290 genes (intersection of HPRD and OncoKB ) is given in the file "Data".
